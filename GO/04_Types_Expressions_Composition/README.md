### Types 

- Basic Types - numbers, strings, booleans
- Aggregate Types - arrays structs
- Reference Types - Pointers, slices, maps, functions, channels 
- Interface Type 

### Expressions 

- Boolean if
- Compound boolean if
- switch

### Composition 

- Composition vs. Inheritance 
- Go is not OOP 
- Example: car in OOP, car with composition 

## Summary 

---

- Basic types - int, float32, float64, boolean, string, rune 
- Aggregate types - arrays, structs 
- Reference types - pointers, slices, maps, function, channel 
- Interface type 
- In order to implement an interface, a type must implement all of the methods of that interface 
- Boolean expressions - false, num > 10, == != > < >= <= 
- Compound booleans - (x > 10) && (y < 20)

- Composition - embedding types in types 
- Exported vs Unexported - capitalization matters for:
  - package level constants 
  - package level variables 
  - functions 
  - types
