## Summary 

--- 

- Go only has the for loop, while other programming languages have for, while, do while loops
- Three part for loop: initialize; condition; iterator, e.g. 
```go
for i := 0; i <= 10; i++ {
	// do something
}
```
- While loop
```go
for x === true {
	// do something 
}
```
- Infinite loop
```go
for {
  // do something 
}
```
